### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--I am a *tech YouTuber*. I like to make malwares (ex: lol.exe) and programs (ex: Windows Product Key finder). Note they are apps made by me, in batch and sometimes vbs. I just understand those, not others, I don't know why. Batch is easy for me because I always work with cmd.exe.

I also like to destroy Windows in various ways, like merging registry, deleting files, even swapping system files between Windows versions.

Check out *my repositories* for programs and malwares you like! :D
